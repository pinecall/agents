# Writing an agent

An agent is one TypeScript class, the default export of `agents/<slug>/agent.tsx`. Everything the
model can see about it comes from four places: the docstring above the class, what the class
declares, the docstrings of its tools, and `render()`.

```tsx
import { Agent } from "@pinecall/agents";

/**
 * You are the front desk of Clínica Norte. Formal, short sentences.
 * Everything you say is read aloud: no lists, no markdown.
 */
export default class ClinicaNorte extends Agent {}
```

That docstring is the `identity` block of the prompt — the first of the static blocks, which never
change during a call and are what a provider caches. Write it as instructions to a person, not as
documentation. It must be a `/** … */` comment directly above the class: the CLI hands the class
its own source, so the comment survives compilation. `static doc = "…"` says it instead, for a
build that strips comments.

## Config: what the agent *is*

Written on the class, because it is not something the agent remembers. It never changes during a
call and no view renders it.

| written | what it does |
|---|---|
| `channelRules = false` | leaves out the `<channel>` part of the prompt: how to write for a voice, a website's chat, WhatsApp |
| `static slug = "front-desk"` | the name the agent registers as; left out, the folder's name. A class served under another slug is refused |
| `static events = { "slot.released": { from: ["app"] } }` | the outside events the agent takes, and from whom: `app` is your backend, `participant` a browser in the call |

### The world's, not the class's

Everything the agent **runs on** is the world's: set per world, versioned, with who set it and
why, and changed without a deploy — by `pinecall agent set`, the console's Settings tab, or the
verb the table names. A class that still declares one of these fields is refused when it loads,
before a prompt is printed or a gateway is knocked at, with the verb that sets it now:

```
`voice` is the world's now, not the class's: pinecall agent set --voice <name> — remove it from the class
```

| field | what it is | where it is set |
|---|---|---|
| `voice` | a voice **by name** — the platform resolves it to a vendor and an id | `pinecall agent set --voice` |
| `llm` | `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, or `vendor/model` | `pinecall agent set --llm` |
| `stt` | the ears: `deepgram` (Flux), `soniox`, or `vendor/model` | `pinecall agent set --stt` |
| `language` | the language the call is in | `pinecall agent set --language` |
| `greeting` | how the call opens: the words, or what the model reads before finding its own | `pinecall agent set --greeting '…'` · `--reply '…'` |
| `hangup` | whether the model may end the call itself, and when, in your words | `pinecall agent set --hangup '…'` |
| `says` | how a word the voice would misread is said | `pinecall lexicon add <word> --say '…'` |
| `hears` | the words the ears must know: names, brands, the doctor's surname | `pinecall lexicon hear <word> …` |
| `memory` | what to remember about a caller across calls, and what never to | `pinecall memory policy --remember '…' --forget '…'` |
| `record` | whether the call is recorded | `pinecall agent set --record on\|off` |
| `knowledge` | what the agent knows by heart: a page of Markdown, read whole on every call | `pinecall agent knowledge edit` |
| `docs` | the bases the agent searches per turn | `pinecall docs push`, then `pinecall docs attach <base>` |

**Neither a fact the agent remembers nor a chunk of a base ever reaches the prompt.** Both arrive
as a tool result, in the history, where a model reads them as information rather than as an
instruction. A tool that searches calls `this.knowledge.search(…)`; the class says nothing else
about it, and a class that reads `this.knowledge` is refused at registration when no base is
attached, rather than at the first turn.

## State: what it remembers

Every own field of the instance is state, and so is every getter. Each call gets its own instance,
so field initializers run once per call and two callers never share a list.

```tsx
import { Agent, state, type Stages } from "@pinecall/agents";

export default class ClinicaNorte extends Agent {
  @state stage: Stages<"identify" | "choose" | "book" | "done"> = "identify";
  @state({ pii: true }) patient?: Patient | undefined;
  @state slots: Slot[] = [];
  @state proposed?: Slot | undefined;

  get identified() {          // derived: in every snapshot, assigned by nobody
    return this.patient !== undefined;
  }

  private agenda() {          // a method is a collaborator, never state
    return new Agenda();
  }
}
```

- **`stage`** is typed with `Stages<…>`, which names its values once: a tool's `stage` uses the same
  words, and a misspelled stage is a compile error.
- **`@state`** says who may see a field: `@state({ pii: true })` masks it in the log,
  `@state({ visibility: "public" })` lets a participant's browser read it, and bare `@state` is the
  default, `tenant`. **Decorating one field decides them all**: a class with no `@state` has every
  field as state, and a class with any has those and nothing else. An undecorated field is then
  scratch space, out of the prompt, the log and goldens — `stage` included, so the tools it gates
  would never show. Decorate every field, or none.
- **A getter is state**, read every time the state is copied. A collaborator belongs in a method.

**Tools and hooks are the only writers.** Once the agent is sealed — every call seals its instance —
a write anywhere else throws `UnauthoredWrite`:

```
state field patient was assigned outside a tool and outside a lifecycle hook; tools are the only writers of state
```

Every write is recorded with its author — the tool's name, `hook:onCall`, `event:<name>` — carried
by `AsyncLocalStorage`, so two calls served at the same moment never read each other's.
`this.collapse("…")` replaces the record with one sentence; `this.log(name, data)` writes a line of
your own into the call's log.

## Tools: what the model may do

```tsx
/** Finds the patient's file by their full name and phone. Call it only once you have both. */
@tool({ stage: "identify", pii: ["name", "phone"] })
async findPatient(name: string, phone: string): Promise<Patient | null> {
  this.patient = await this.agenda().find(name, phone);
  if (this.patient) this.stage = "choose";
  return this.patient ?? null;
}
```

The docstring is what the model reads to choose the tool, joined into one line. The signature is
the schema it fills: `string`, `number`, `boolean` and arrays of them are typed; an interface or a
type declared in the same file is read field by field; an optional parameter is not required. What
the model sends is checked against it before the method runs.

| option | what it does |
|---|---|
| `stage` | visible while the state is in this stage, or one of these: `stage: ["choose", "book"]` |
| `when` | a question asked of the state on every change: `when: (s) => s.slots.length > 0` |
| `confirm` | the sentence said after the tool runs. **This is what makes a tool irreversible on the wire**; `{{result.x}}` names a field of what it returns |
| `preview` | how many items of a list the *model* sees. The state keeps every one |
| `pii` | the parameters that carry personal data, masked in the log |
| `timeout` | how many seconds the platform waits for this method: 30 unless set, 300 at most |
| `params` | an explicit zod schema, when the signature is not enough |

A tool that throws does not crash the call: its message becomes the tool's result, marked as an
error, and the model reads it. Throw a sentence a model can use — "Tuesday has no free slots" —
never a stack trace. And ask the model for a word, not a record: `book(slot: string)`, looked up
among the slots it was offered, is safer than `book(slot: Slot)`.

## The hooks

```tsx
override async onCall(call: Call) {   // a call started; writes here are authored by the hook
  this.patient = await this.agenda().byPhone(call.from ?? "");
  if (this.patient) this.stage = "choose";
}

override onEnd(call: Call) {          // a line logged here still lands
  this.log("outcome", { stage: this.stage });
}

override onEvent(name: string, data: Record<string, unknown>, meta: EventMeta) {}   // an accepted outside fact
override onMemory(ops: MemoryOp[], call: Call) {}                                   // memory read or written
```

`onCall` runs before the first prompt goes out, so the model never reads a state the call was not
in; the state a golden or a persona opens the call in is applied after it, so the hook never
overwrites it. An outside fact reaches `onEvent` only if the class declared the pair in
`static events`: an event declared `from: ["app"]` that arrives from a browser is somebody else's
event with your name on it, and the hook never sees it.

## The call

Inside a tool, a hook or `render()`, `this.call` is the live call; outside one it throws.

```tsx
await this.say("One moment, let me check.");        // true once the turn lands, false after 30 s
await this.reply("Tell them it is booked.");        // the model speaks, guided by words nobody hears
this.call.send("cart", { total: 42 });              // a payload to the browsers in the room
this.call.participant(identity).mute();             // and .remove()
this.call.invite("+34910000001", { kind: "sip" });  // a phone leg into the call
await this.call.transfer("+34910000002");           // { ok, to, mode, error? }: ok false if they are still here
await this.call.attention("wants to talk to a person", { waitS: 60 });   // { ok, by, error? }
this.call.hold();                                   // and unhold()
this.call.dtmf("1#");
this.call.claim("4821");                            // the page showing 4821 follows this call
this.call.callback("+34600000001", { when: "tomorrow afternoon", note: "a quote" });
this.call.optOut("does not want more calls");       // their number joins the do-not-call list
this.call.hangup("done");
await this.knowledge.search("summer opening hours", { k: 3 });   // the chunks, searched for this call
```

`this.call` also carries `id`, `contact`, `from`, `channel`, `medium`, `today` — the day the call
opened, which is what "next Tuesday" is counted from — `history`, `room` and `claimed`.

There is no LiveKit here and no escape hatch to it: a need the room cannot express is a new
command with a name.

## The panel beside a conversation: `@view`

The console draws a pane beside every thread in **Calls**. A class that declares a view has its own
panel drawn there — the customer's file, their orders, the balance — from your own systems:

```tsx
import { Agent, view, type Who } from "@pinecall/agents";
import { Badge, Panel, Row, Rows, Stat, Table } from "@pinecall/agents/panels";

async function CustomerCard(who: Who) {
  const client = await crm.find(who.contact);
  if (client === undefined) return <Panel title="Not on file">Not in the CRM.</Panel>;
  return (
    <Panel title={client.name}>
      <Rows>
        <Row label="Since">{client.since}</Row>
        <Row label="Area">{client.area}</Row>
      </Rows>
      <Stat label="Jobs" value={client.jobs.length} />
      <Table columns={["date", "job", "amount"]} rows={client.jobs} />
      <Badge tone={client.debt > 0 ? "warn" : "good"}>{client.debt > 0 ? "owes" : "paid up"}</Badge>
    </Panel>
  );
}

@view(CustomerCard, "Customer")
export default class ClinicaNorte extends Agent {}
```

What reaches the console is a tree of the closed catalogue — `Panel`, `Rows`, `Row`, `Stat`,
`Table`, `Badge`, `Text` — drawn by the console's own parts; nothing a tenant writes reaches the
page's styling or its scripts. `who` is the conversation — `agent`, `contact`, `call` — and nothing
else: the panel is read beside threads that ended weeks ago, so it fetches what it shows. One per
class.

## What is refused when the class loads

Every one of these is refused before any call, with a message that says what to write:

| refused | the sentence |
|---|---|
| a tool with no docstring | `tool book: without a docstring no model can choose it; write a /** one line */ above the method` |
| a tool name a model cannot call | `a tool name is one word a model can call, not …` |
| `pii: ["dni"]` on a tool with no `dni` | `tool book: pii names parameters the tool has; unknown: dni` |
| `stage` on a class with no `stage` field | `tool book: stage names a value of this agent's own stage field, and ClinicaNorte declares none; add \`stage: Stages<"…"> = "…"\` to the class, or ask when(state) instead` |
| `@tool` on something that is not a method | `@tool goes on a method; … is not one` |
| `@state({ pii: true, visibility: "public" })` | `two different answers to one question; write one` |
| both `@render(Prompt)` and a `render()` method | `ClinicaNorte declares both @render(Prompt) and a render() method; two ways to answer one question — keep one` |
| two `@view` decorators | `ClinicaNorte declares two views (…); a class draws one panel` |
| `voice`, `llm`, `stt`, `language`, `greeting`, `hangup`, `says`, `hears`, `memory`, `record`, `knowledge`, `docs` | `` `<field>` is the world's now, not the class's: <verb> — remove it from the class`` |
