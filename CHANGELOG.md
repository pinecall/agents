# Changelog

All notable changes to `pinecall`, the package a tenant writes an agent in. The format is
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); version numbers and tags are the
maintainer's call, so everything sits under Unreleased until one is cut.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The framework, from zero: the `Agent` base whose fields are the state and whose every assignment
  is a change with an author; `@tool` with `when` / `stage` / `confirm` / `preview` / `pii` /
  `timeout`; docstrings read out of the class's own source; `@state({ visibility })`;
  `static events`; the four lifecycle hooks; `collapse`, `restore`, `startIn`, `last(contact)`.
- The views: JSX that renders to text, the three prompt regions in one order, the markers the
  gateway fills (`Memory`, `Retrieved`, `Knowledge`) and the render props one render leaves behind.
- The live call as a value: the room reduced from its own entries, the turns, and the six verbs —
  `say`, `reply`, `send`, `mute`/`remove`, `invite` — each one command on the wire.
- `pinecall/client`: one socket, the agents on it, the tool calls it answers, and any log the key
  can read, folded by the protocol's own reducer. Plus `pinecall/client/testing`, a gateway and a
  log that are not there, so an app's own suite needs neither a network nor a key.
- The bridge: `mount()` — one live instance per call, the opening state seam, and a sync that
  sends only the region whose text actually changed.
- The CLI: `run`, `chat`, `ui`, `prompt`, `test`, `simulate`, `eval`, `runs`, `personas`, `login`,
  `whoami` — and `groups.ts`, which declares every verb the design names and this tree has not
  written, so a person is told what a verb *will* be instead of "unknown command".
- One resolution order for the gateway and the key (`cli/env.ts`), `~/.pinecall` at 0600, and a
  gateway on a dev key that ignores an exported `PINECALL_API_KEY` out loud.
- The console `pinecall ui` serves on 127.0.0.1 under a nonce: Talk, Calls (live), Sessions,
  Pipeline and Evals. The org key never reaches the browser.
- Two examples written the way a customer writes one — `clinica-norte`, `tienda-sur` — with their
  goldens, personas and prompt-region tests; CI (`scripts/check`) and a nightly that drives both
  on two models and watches each judge's drift.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/` (writing an agent, the prompt, testing, the CLI), and
  `.claude/skills/`.

### Changed
- Comments naming a page of the runtime's engineering notebook now say **the runtime's**
  `docs/decisions/<page>.md`: read from this repository, the bare path pointed at a file that is
  not here.
- `pinecall simulate --judge` names `pinecall-runtime sessions show <id>` (and the console) when a
  call never seals. It used to name `pinecall sessions show`, a verb this CLI declares and has not
  written, so the sentence sent a person to a stub.

### Removed
- `@pinecall/web`, the browser package: nobody installed it and it read a projection nobody read.
