// One program lives in this repo now: the framework and its CLI. The console — a browser page
// whose JSX compiles against React's — is a repo of its own (../console), and it took its two
// directories of tests with it, which is why this config has no projects in it any more.
//
// Decorators: measured, not assumed — tsc, esbuild and tsx all take TC39 standard decorators and
// vite's oxc transform does not, so the package is written against the legacy ones. The table and
// the migration are in docs/decisions/agent.md.
//
// JSX: a view is a .tsx file whose factory is our own text runtime, reached by the specifier a
// tenant writes — package.json's exports point at the sources, so nothing here is aliased and
// there is no dist between the source and the test.
