// The tenant, run against the fake gateway: no network, no key, no model.
//
// The decorator and JSX settings are the framework's own — a tenant writing `@tool` and a `.tsx`
// view needs the same toolchain flags the package is written against, and gets them from
// pinecall/tsconfig.tenant.json. Vitest reads none of that: its transform is oxc's, so the same
// two facts are repeated here until oxc can read a tsconfig (docs/decisions/agent.md).
//
// Nothing is aliased. This example resolves `pinecall` exactly as a customer does, through
// node_modules; the package's exports lead to its sources here and to its dist from npm.
